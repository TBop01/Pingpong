Scoreboard v1 files contains the scoreboard and a topic generator. This topic is debated between two players using the target language. 
The winner is decided by a third party who activates the scoreboard to add a point. When a player reaches 5 points a play again message should generate along with a jingle.
Rules file contains the 8-bit logo and a play game button which activates the audio file explaining the rules. 


I have added the unzipped files. I think the main issue is the lack of responsiveness which can be solved by bootstrap (?). Text boxes for player one and player two are overlapping when launched.
Perhaps simplifying the layout so that the rules, scoreboard and text boxes are all contained within one widget would be better? I will leave for you to decide :)

Thank you
